## 📙 About

With Flipper, NFT collectors can experience the thrill of competition and enjoy a dynamic, gamified environment that increases the utility and engagement of their NFT holdings. Flipper delivers an innovative solution to the problem of fragmented NFT utility and limited gameplay opportunities by providing a platform that combines staking, randomness, and winner-takes-all mechanics.

Flipper's gameplay mechanics are simple yet captivating. Users stake their NFTs in matches, and the smart contract autonomously selects a random winner. To determine the winner, a virtual coin rotates and ultimately reveals the victorious participant. The winner takes possession of all the staked NFTs, creating an exciting element of risk and reward.

Flipper addresses the fragmented utility of NFTs and creates an immersive gaming experience by combining staking mechanics and random winner selection.
